# Duet3D-Rotating-Magnet-Filament-Monitor
SolidWorks, STEP and STL file are included.

I redrawn the whole V2 housing in Solidworks, I share the files if anybody needs it personally for modifications or a redesign. 
Please don't reshare my file's, personal use only! ! !

I share the Solidworks files and STEP files for anyone who needs to modificate the body of the Duet3D Rotating Magnet Filament Monitor

There is a STL file included. If you want to print this product I strongly suggest the following:
1: PLA filament
2: The filament has a excellent filament calibration for the 3D printing machine!
3: Use nozzle 0.25mm
4: Layerheight of 0,1mm, for the first layer it's no problem to use 0,2mm (this is a mild suggestion, layerheight of 0,2mm is also good)
5: A drill of 2,1mm (or 2.0mm if that is only what you have). 

IF you have problems with the filament giving you inconstant value while you monitor or measure the filament. The path of the filament doesn't have enough clearance. You need the drill to make sure the path for the filament is big enough. A hole of 2,1mm is more then enough, I suggest no bigger then 2,1mm! ! !

If you have over or under-extrusion and the 3D printer is not stabile/precise and you are not willing to mount a 0,25mm nozzle I strongly suggest you download the STL files from the Duet3D webpage https://docs.duet3d.com/. These files are only for high quality prints or for easy modifications in Solidworks.
